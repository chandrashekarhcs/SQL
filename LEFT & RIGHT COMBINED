/* Explanation: 
SELECT DISTINCT CITY → Get city names without duplicates ✓
LEFT(CITY, 1) → Gets the first character of the city name ✓
IN('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') → Checks if it's a vowel ✓
AND → BOTH conditions must be true ✓
RIGHT(CITY, 1) → Gets the last character of the city name ✓
IN('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') → Checks if it's a vowel ✓ */
